# Call ID Tracking and Variable Passing Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Call ID Mismatch Problem**
**Issue**: The CallQueueSystem was using its internal queue IDs instead of the backend's call_id, causing tracking failures.

**Fix**: 
- Modified `queue_api_service.py` to properly handle `custom_call_id` as the backend's call_id
- Updated `plivo_integration.py` to pass `backend_call_id` from config to the voice bot
- Fixed `server.py` in PipecatPlivoOutbound to use the backend's call_id for tracking

**Files Changed**:
- `CallQueueSystem/queue_api_service.py` - Lines 160-190
- `CallQueueSystem/plivo_integration.py` - Lines 110-135  
- `PipecatPlivoOutbound/server.py` - Lines 67-100

### 2. **Backend Notification Endpoint Mismatch**
**Issue**: The queue system was sending completion data to wrong endpoint (`/api/calls/results` instead of `/api/calls/external-updates`).

**Fix**:
- Updated `call_queue_manager.py` to send data to correct backend endpoint
- Enhanced payload structure to match what backend expects (same format as Temporal workflow)
- Added comprehensive data mapping including transcript extraction from nested agent response

**Files Changed**:
- `CallQueueSystem/call_queue_manager.py` - Lines 269-350

### 3. **Variable Passing Through Chain**
**Issue**: Variables from CSV were not being properly passed through the entire call chain.

**Fix**:
- Enhanced `queue_api_service.py` to store variables in `call_config`
- Updated `plivo_integration.py` to extract and pass variables to voice bot
- Modified `server.py` to properly extract variables from both request and config
- Fixed WebSocket endpoint to pass variables to bot runtime

**Files Changed**:
- `CallQueueSystem/queue_api_service.py` - Lines 170-175
- `CallQueueSystem/plivo_integration.py` - Lines 125-130
- `PipecatPlivoOutbound/server.py` - Lines 85-90, 355-360

### 4. **Call Completion Notification**
**Issue**: Voice bot wasn't notifying the queue system when calls completed, so backend never received completion data.

**Fix**:
- Added `notify_queue_system_completion()` function in `bot.py`
- Modified `on_client_disconnected` handler to send completion notification
- Enhanced completion payload with comprehensive call result data

**Files Changed**:
- `PipecatPlivoOutbound/bot.py` - Lines 291-350, 600-610

### 5. **Data Structure Consistency**
**Issue**: The data structure sent to backend didn't match what the backend controller expected.

**Fix**:
- Aligned payload structure with the original Temporal workflow format
- Added comprehensive data mapping including:
  - Transcript extraction from nested locations
  - Recording URL handling
  - Agent response structure
  - Metadata and timing information

**Files Changed**:
- `CallQueueSystem/call_queue_manager.py` - Lines 280-340

## Data Flow After Fixes

```
Backend Request â†’ CallQueueSystem â†’ Plivo Integration â†’ Voice Bot â†’ Queue System â†’ Backend
     â†“                â†“                    â†“               â†“            â†“           â†“

variables       â†’ stored in config â†’ passed to bot â†’ used in prompts  â†’ included   â†’ stored
```

## Key Configuration Changes

### Environment Variables Added:
```bash
# In PipecatPlivoOutbound
QUEUE_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8001
```

### Call ID Tracking Strategy:
- **Backend Call ID**: Used for end-to-end tracking (what backend expects)
- **Queue Job ID**: Used internally by queue system for job management  
- **Plivo Call UUID**: Used by Plivo for telephony operations

### Variable Passing Chain:
1. Backend sends variables in `call_config.variables`
2. Queue system stores in enhanced config with `backend_call_id`
3. Plivo integration extracts and passes to voice bot
4. Voice bot uses variables in prompts and conversation
5. Completion data includes variables for backend storage

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test:
```bash
cd CallQueueSystem
python test_complete_flow.py
```

This test verifies:
- Call queuing with proper call_id handling
- Variable passing through the chain
- Call completion notification
- Backend data reception

## Verification Points

1. **Queue Logs**: Should show backend_call_id being used for tracking
2. **Voice Bot Logs**: Should show variables being loaded and used
3. **Backend Logs**: Should receive completion data with correct call_id and variables
4. **Call Status**: Backend should see calls with proper transcript and recording data

## Expected Log Flow

```
Queue: âœ… Call queued: Queue ID: queue-123, Backend ID: backend-456
Plivo: ðŸ“¤ Notifying agent server with backend call_id: backend-456
Voice Bot: ðŸ“ž Call registered - Backend ID: backend-456, Variables: 5 fields
Voice Bot: ðŸ“¤ Notifying queue system about call completion: backend-456  
Queue: ðŸ“¤ Sending call results to backend with call_id: backend-456
Backend: âœ… Received call completion data for backend-456
```

All systems now properly track the backend's call_id and pass variables through the entire chain, ensuring complete data flow from request to completion.
